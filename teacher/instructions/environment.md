# Development Environment

- VS Code
- Java JDK
- KickAssembler
- VICE Emulator
- SID Factory II
- VS Code extension KickAss
- C64 65XE NES Debugger: https://sourceforge.net/projects/c64-debugger/
- Shared VS Code tasks are in `.vscode/tasks.json` (build output in root `bin/`).
- If KickAss extension keybindings are used instead of workspace tasks, they may bypass workspace task settings; prefer task-based build/run/debug.
